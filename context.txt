A linear function is expressed as y = ax, where: 
- 'a' is the slope. If 'a' > 0, the line goes up; if 'a' < 0, the line goes down; if 'a' = 0, the line is horizontal. 
- To increase a linear function, increase the value of 'a'.
- To make a linear function go down, set 'a' < 0.

A quadratic function is expressed as y = ax^2, where: 
- 'a' determines the parabola's direction and steepness. If 'a' > 0, the parabola opens upwards; if 'a' < 0, the parabola opens downwards. 
- To increase a quadratic function, increase the absolute value of 'a' to make the parabola steeper.
- To make a quadratic function go down, set 'a' < 0.

A sinus function is expressed as y = A * sin(Bx + C) + D, where: 
- 'A' is the amplitude. It determines the height of the wave:
  - If 'A' > 0, the wave oscillates between D - A and D + A.
  - If 'A' < 0, the wave is inverted, making the wave "go down" relative to its baseline.
- To increase the amplitude of a sinusoidal function, increase the absolute value of 'A'.
- To make a sinus function go down, set 'A' < 0.

A cosine function is expressed as y = A * cos(Bx + C) + D, where: 
- 'A' is the amplitude, determining the height of the wave:
  - If 'A' > 0, the wave oscillates between D - A and D + A.
  - If 'A' < 0, the wave is inverted, making the wave "go down" relative to its baseline.
- To increase the amplitude of a cosine function, increase the absolute value of 'A'.
- To make a cosine function go down, set 'A' < 0.

An exponential function is expressed as y = a * e^(bx), where: 
- 'a' is the initial value or scaling factor. It determines the value of y when x = 0.
- 'b' is the growth rate:
  - If 'b' > 0, the function grows exponentially as x increases.
  - If 'b' < 0, the function decreases exponentially as x increases.
- To increase an exponential function, increase the value of 'a' or 'b'.
- To make an exponential function go down, set 'b' < 0.
