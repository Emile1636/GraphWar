A linear function is expressed as y = ax, where: 
- 'a' is the slope: if 'a' > 0, the line goes up; if 'a' < 0, it goes down; if 'a' = 0, it is horizontal. 
To increase the slope or make the line go up more quickly, increase the value of 'a' in y = ax. 
A greater slope means that the line goes up more quickly, while a smaller slope makes the 
ascent or descent less steep. Changing 'a' directly changes the inclination of the line in a Cartesian graph. 
For a more gradual rise, simply decrease 'a' slightly without making it negative.
